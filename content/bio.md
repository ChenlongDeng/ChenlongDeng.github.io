Chenlong Deng is a fourth-year PhD student at the [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China](https://en.ruc.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Zhicheng Dou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XLqF8_AAAAAJ&hl=en). He received his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Renmin University of China in 2022.

His research lies at the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Information Retrieval (IR), with a current focus on two directions:
1. **Efficient Long-Context Language Models**: exploring sparsity and compression techniques to enable LLMs to process extended contexts efficiently.
2. **Deep Search Agents**: investigating LLM-based agentic systems for complex, multi-step information seeking.

His work is grounded in years of research experience in information retrieval, spanning both fundamental and applied topics.

He is actively seeking research internship and full-time opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaboration.
